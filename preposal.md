# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. You mentioned an idea of hangman but the hangman cheat so it's impossible to win. I thought that might be fun.
2. Pac-man but every level you fine, a new ghost is added and the maze layout change.
3. Maybe blackjack.
4. A side-scrolling game where the character needs to pass several obstacles.
5. Tetris but in a set interval of time, the screen will flip on its side, with the blocks staying in place.
6. A game where the player needs to guess a character's birthday based on items and clothes they have.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

No, I plan to work alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not that I can think of. Although, that might change.
